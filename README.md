This repo contains melodies, written in C, to be played using Raspberry Pi and floppy disk drive 
This was made using [XtraPerianer's guide](https://xtraperianer.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/making-floppy-music-with-a-raspberry-pi/?lang=en)

## To assemble this you need:

* Raspberry Pi
* floppy disk drive
* power source; it's perfect if you have one from an old PC, it should be 5V
* wires to connect everything, e.g. the power source and the battery
* jumper wires or jumpers

Also you need to install [wiringPi lib](http://wiringpi.com/) in order to run the code.
